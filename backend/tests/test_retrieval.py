"""
Isolation tests for unstructured retrieval — the account_id boundary in
retrieval.py is a real correctness/security property, not a nice-to-have:
a leak here means one account's private notes surfacing in another
account's answer. These run against the real seeded data and the real
pgvector index, not a mock, the same way the SQL safety tests exercise
the real datalens_readonly role.
