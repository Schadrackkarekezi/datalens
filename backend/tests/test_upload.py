"""
The upload isolation guarantee is a real correctness/security property,
same category as the SQL safety tests — a leak here means one account's
uploaded note surfacing in another account's (or a global) answer. These
run against the real database and the real pgvector index, uploading and
then immediately attacking the isolation boundary, the same discipline
used for the SQL disguised-write live-attack test.
