"""
Tests for the safety boundary in query_engine.run_select().

These are the most important tests in the project — this is the function
that decides whether AI-generated (or hand-typed) SQL is allowed to touch
the database at all. The actual enforcement is Postgres's own privilege
system (the datalens_readonly role has SELECT and nothing else — see
schema.sql), so these tests are exercising a real database role, not a
mock of one.
