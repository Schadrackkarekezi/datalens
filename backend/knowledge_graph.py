"""
A lightweight knowledge graph over the schema, used to give the agent
explicit join-path hints instead of making it infer join paths from a flat
column list alone.

This is deliberately NOT a separate graph database — the graph is built
in-memory (networkx) from two things that are already sources of truth:
the schema's actual foreign keys (database.fetch_foreign_keys — so the
graph can't drift out of sync with the real schema) and ontology.json,
which adds the semantic layer FKs don't carry on their own: what an entity
*means* (aliases for matching natural-language questions to tables) and
what a relationship *means* (a human label for each FK edge, not just
"column X references column Y").

The concrete payoff: text-to-SQL agents most often go wrong on multi-table
joins, because a flat schema listing doesn't tell the model *how* two
tables connect when there's more than one hop between them. Given a
question, find_relevant_entities() matches mentioned concepts to tables,
and find_join_paths() computes the actual path between them via graph
traversal — e.g. "employees -> activities -> deals -> products" — and
that path gets handed to the model as a hint, not discovered by guessing.
