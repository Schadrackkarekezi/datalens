Rough cost estimation for OpenAI API calls, for the observability dashboard.

Rates are approximate and will drift as OpenAI changes pricing — treat this
as "good enough to spot a cost spike," not a billing-accurate ledger. Check
current rates at openai.com/api/pricing before trusting this for real
budget decisions.
