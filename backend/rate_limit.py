"""
Simple in-memory sliding-window rate limiter for /ask specifically — the
one endpoint that costs real money per call. /query and /schema are free
local reads and aren't limited.

In-memory and per-process by design: fine for a single-instance demo
deployment. A multi-instance production deployment would move this state
to Redis so limits are enforced across processes, not per-process.
