"""
Unstructured retrieval over document_chunks, backed by pgvector — the
production-grade replacement for the old in-memory FAISS index (rag.py,
deleted in the Postgres rewrite). Same embedding model, same normalize +
cosine-similarity approach; the real difference is where the vectors
live: inside Postgres, alongside the structured data they get combined
with for hybrid answers, instead of a separate in-memory index rebuilt
from scratch on every process start.

Connects through the same datalens_readonly role query_engine.py uses —
this is a SELECT-only workload, so it gets the same least-privilege
connection as everything else that touches the database on the agent's
behalf, not a separate admin connection just because it's a different
kind of query.

account_id filtering happens in the SQL WHERE clause, not by filtering
results after the fact — an account-scoped call only ever sees that
account's notes plus global enablement content, never another account's
notes. This is the actual isolation boundary Phase 11's upload feature
depends on; filtering after retrieval would only be a UI-layer illusion
of isolation, not a real one.
