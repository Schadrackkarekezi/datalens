"""
Verified query repository - a small set of question -> SQL pairs that have
already passed both the deterministic checks and the LLM judge in the eval
suite (see verified_queries.json's "verified_via" field, and eval_set.json).
"Verified" means "passed the eval suite," not "someone eyeballed it once."

On /ask, if the incoming question closely matches one of these, the agent
skips LLM generation entirely and runs the pre-verified SQL directly -
still through the exact same query_engine.run_select() safety guard as
every other query, just skipping the (cost- and latency-incurring)
generation step. This is a real optimization, not just a trust badge: a
verified match costs $0 and runs in milliseconds instead of a few cents
and a couple of seconds.

Backed by pgvector (see the verified_queries table and
seed_verified_queries.py), not an in-memory FAISS index rebuilt from JSON
on every process start - the embeddings live precomputed in Postgres,
alongside the structured data, matched here the same way retrieval.py
matches document_chunks.

Threshold calibration matters more here than in document retrieval,
because a false-positive match means silently serving the WRONG cached
answer instead of just missing a retrieval. Empirically (see git history
for the calibration script): true paraphrases of the same question score
0.92-1.0 cosine similarity; a *related but meaningfully different*
question - "what is our win rate" vs "what is our win rate BY
DEPARTMENT" - still scores 0.80, since embedding models cluster on
topic, not exact scope. MATCH_THRESHOLD is set well above that gap.
