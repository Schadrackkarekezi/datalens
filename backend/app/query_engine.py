"""
Executes read-only SQL against the datalens_readonly Postgres role.

The safety boundary here is the database itself, not this file: the
connecting role has been granted SELECT and nothing else, at the Postgres
privilege level (see schema.sql). A write statement doesn't get rejected
by this code recognizing it as dangerous - it gets rejected by Postgres
because the role is structurally incapable of writing, the same way a
read replica is. This is the direct equivalent of the original SQLite
implementation's set_authorizer hook, ported to Postgres's idiomatic
mechanism: SQLite has no user model, so a compile-time callback was the
right SQLite-native answer; Postgres has a real multi-user privilege
system, so a dedicated role is the right Postgres-native answer.

Three defenses stack here, in order:
  1. Reject multiple statements at the application layer (belt and
     suspenders - don't rely solely on driver behavior).
  2. Wrap every query in a subquery + LIMIT, so no result set can be
     larger than MAX_ROWS regardless of what was asked.
  3. A Postgres statement_timeout, set per-connection, so no query can
     run longer than TIMEOUT_SECONDS regardless of what it's doing.

Even if all three were somehow bypassed, step zero - the role's actual
privileges - is still there underneath, enforced by the database engine
itself rather than by this file being correct.
