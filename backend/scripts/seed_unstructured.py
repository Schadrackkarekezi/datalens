"""
Seeds the unstructured side of DataLens: account_notes (account-scoped CS/
sales free text) and enablement_content (global battlecards/plays/FAQs),
both chunked into document_chunks — the table Phase 08's pgvector
retrieval actually searches over. Embeddings are left NULL here; that's
Phase 08's job, once the retrieval module exists to generate them with.

account_notes are generated from the real seeded structured data, not
hand-written — a note's numbers (consumption ratio, committed amount,
CSM name) come straight from the same accounts/capacity_contracts/
consumption_usage tables the SQL agent queries, so a hybrid answer that
pulls both the trend (structured) and the narrative (unstructured) will
find them actually agreeing, the same discipline used for seed_db.py's
correlated data. enablement_content is hand-authored, since it's meant to
be general company knowledge, not tied to any one account's numbers.

Deterministic (random.seed(43) — different from seed_db.py's 42, so this
script's own randomized phrasing choices don't shift if seed_db.py's
generation logic ever changes) and truncate-and-reinsert, like seed_db.py.
