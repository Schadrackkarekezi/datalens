"""
Loads verified_queries.json into the verified_queries table and embeds
each question — verified_queries.json stays the human-edited source of
truth (each entry's provenance recorded in verified_via, normally derived
from a passing eval run), this script is just what pushes it into the
place find_verified_match() actually reads from.

Truncate-and-reinsert, like seed_db.py and seed_unstructured.py — safe to
re-run any time verified_queries.json changes.

Usage: python -m scripts.seed_verified_queries   (run from backend/)
